Always aim to answer:
  What does the following code output and return?
  Why?
  What concept does it demonstrate?

###PUTS v RETURN###
  return - every method returns the evaluated result of the last line that is executed
            unless a specific `return` is come before it.
         - when `return` is placed within a method, it just returns the evaluated result of the following code
              without executing any further lines.           
  p - prints out the value returned by the following code/method
  puts - displays the results of evaluating Ruby code with a new line at the end, and returns nil
